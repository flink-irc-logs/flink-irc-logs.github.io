<span class="irc-date">[8:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Slackbot5&gt; &lt;stephan&gt; Flink brings up worker JVMs that stay around for multiple jobs, if you want to.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Slackbot5&gt; &lt;stephan&gt; For use with YARN, there are both options: (1) start a "session", which means start a set of worker JVMs and use them for many jobs, then shut them down (2) start workers dedicated for one job and shut them down again</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Slackbot5&gt; &lt;stephan&gt; Inside one jobs, JVMs usually handle more than one type operator (such as mappers and reducers)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Slackbot5&gt; &lt;stephan&gt; a single JVM can also have multiple slots for multiple concurrent mappers or reducers (or joins or whatever), which can be useful if you have data sets that are broadcasted or otherwise shared between mappers/reducers</span><br />
